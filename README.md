# uxv

uxv = unix v = unix 5 = fifth part (at least for me):
1. unix from bell labs
2. bsd
3. linux
4. macos & android
5. my play with ed and sh

why edv and shv?
the same reason as for uxv

why this?
it is when i'm 50 i met and learned about unix and it is also ~50 years from genesis of unix
and i like unix story and system so i'll try to make new ed and sh just for fun and enjoyment
and i plan to write my edv on (old) ed
just like ken wrote first unix software on (probably) qed and on Model 33 Teletype
but maybe if things get compolex i continue with vi
(and afther that with visual studio code or something similar)

why (net) bsd?
only bsd which is working good enough in vm
while i'm stll trying to make oi solaris work at satisfactory level

why (open indiana) solaris?
the only free original unix which worked well in virtual machine and
oracle (sun) 11-3 and 11-4 solaris didn't work well in vm
but oi is not functional because of problem with scroll for mouse
so bsd will be the first option until scroll is fixed
oracle solaris intsall images are not for dev and prod and commerce
but just for testing so their licence is not suitable if my project evolves further

uxv development on open indiana (based on sun solaris express) and tests on fedora, oracle solaris, netbsd

uxv is project to learn unix and go

why vm?
because i don't have another comp and even if i had i have no more space on my desk for it

why go lang and not c, c++, rust etc.?
bsd and solaris are distant advanced versions of ancient unix and
go through c is advanced version of b and
ken who made b is also one of the creators of go and
today c is mainly for system programmers and go could have better prospect to learn
for other applications

first version would be written in ed
seccond in vi
third in sam?
fourth in emacs
fifth in vscode
