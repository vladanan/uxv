# uxv

This is a memorial project for Unix and line editor ed.

**What is the meaning of ux and v?**

uxv = Unix V = Unix 5 = Unix fifth part (at least from my personal perspective)(yes I know about Plan 9, Inferno, Limbo and 9P):

1. Ancient Unix from Bell labs
2. BSD
3. Linux
4. macOS & Android
5. my experiments with edv editor, shv shell and uxv OS

**Why I'm doing this?**

Just for programming fun and enjoyment. When I turned 50 It was around the same time as ~50 years since the genesis of Unix. I like both Unix's story and system itself so I'll try to make very small and simple new ed, sh and Unix just to see what will happen.I plan for edv not to be a full screen editor like vi nor even a single line editor as ed. Instead edv will be a single character editor, as strange as it sounds, but with, I hope, some special and interesting features. If that happens to work well then edv might evolve to single line and more. After edv is finished I'll try to make a shv shell and maybe even a uxv operating system. And who knows what else if my imagination and motivation propagates further.

**Why Solaris Unix?**

It's Unix and BSD and Solaris are distant advanced versions of ancient Unix. When Solaris boots one can see that Unix is starting which is nice to see. OpenIndiana Solaris Unix (based on Sun Solaris Express) was the only free original Unix which worked sufficiently well in virtual machine. Oracle (Sun) 11-3 or 11-4 Solaris Unix didn't work well in vm, free install images are not for development or production but just for testing so their licence is not suitable if my project evolves further. NetBSD was used only for testing in the first several iterations of edv but not for development because of the weirdly high constant CPU loads in vm. Further testing will be done on Fedora Linux.

**Why Go and not C, C++, Rust etc.?**

I look at Go,Â through C, as a distant advanced version of ancient B. And Ken who made B is also one of the creators of Go. Today C is mainly for systems programming, which is not my primary interest, and Go has better prospects for other applications at least for me in backend (and web development).

**Why ed editor?**

Programming of edv started in ed as some kind of distant comparison with Ken writing ancient Unix software on qed and Model 33 Teletype. So both this Readme.md file and Go code for edv were entirely written in ed editor in their first iterations. Not an easy task as it appears to me that ed wasn't exactly meant for writing long readme files or code for higher level languages like Go unlike somewhat simpler syntax for early Unix assembly code. I believe that this is the main reason why ex and vi later appeared.

After programming in ed further work will continue in vi(m) and/or Emacs as they are fundamental parts of computer history and editor evolution. After that work will probably continue in Visual Studio Code.
